All the C program code are translated to C++ STL. Smart pointers are used to avoid danger pointers and memory leak.
It is rewritten to support MVC design pattern required by MFC under Visual Studio 2017. It would be a good code reference for C++ programmers. The "model" folder in source code should be portable to other C++ compilers. As mentioned above, to understand the code to display the Windows UI required the fundamental knowledge of Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library. C++ Beginners might find it difficult to understand the code of some essential UI controls. Many thanks to the MFC experts provided the source code of such advanced controls.
 
Welcome for C++ experts for further improvement or contribution of coding enhancement.
